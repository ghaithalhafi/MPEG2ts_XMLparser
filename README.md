This is a C++ MPEG2 parser to XML.
this example used Microsoft visual studio 2019 IDE
tried to match it and run in Ubuntu environment but didn't work, but it's working perfect in Windows 10 OS with no errors.
Didn't have enough time to test it enough, no errors with the code, successfully compiled and built but couldn't show results.

Please note, this code will not modify the PID number but it will export the .ts file to XML output file



MPEG2 Transport Stream to XML
-----------------------------

Windows command line app that will parse an MPEG Transport Stream and generate an XML document which represents the stream.

Example command line.  This will write xml to output.xml, and it will print the progress.

    C:\> mp2ts_parser -p file.mpts > output.xml

The XML files generated by this program can be used as input to my mp2ts_analyzer program.

MPEG files in a transport stream 

I hope it will be accepted.
